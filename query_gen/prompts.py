## Guidelines
- Carefully read and comprehend the title and content of the Amazon help page provided.
- Identify the key points, policies, and procedures mentioned in the guidelines.

    - Cover different aspects of the guidelines
    - Vary in complexity (from simple to more nuanced questions)
    - Are phrased naturally, as a real customer would ask them
    - Can be answered using the information provided in the guidelines
    - Are not direct copies or paraphrases of the guideline content
- Ensure that the queries are diverse and not repetitive.
- Format your output as a JSON object with the original title and an array of {num_queries} queries.

## Guidelines
- Focus on creating queries that real customers would ask, considering various scenarios and potential misunderstandings.
- Avoid using technical jargon unless it's commonly used by customers.
- Note that the typical customer might not be aware of the existence of the guidelines provided to you. So, avoid making references to that in the customer's queries.
- Consider both straightforward and edge-case scenarios that customers might encounter.

Output JSON format:
{{
    "title": "<title given by user>",
    "customer_queries": [
        "1. ...",
        "2. ...",
        ...
    ]
}}

Your goal is to generate queries that accurately reflect what customers ask E-Commerce support agents in real life. The queries should encourage comprehensive use of the provided guidelines to formulate answers.
